my parents were not formally educated so opportunities were pretty limited
platform to leverage my existing knowledge and take it to the next level
The MS-MIS program was the catalyst in helping me shift gears and prepare to work on the higher level
business-oriented thinking to supplement my technical knowledge. 
Given that I have worked in the industry for 8 years, i know very well some of the problems that are 
plaguing the system, i would like to find innovative solutions for the same by expanding by breadth of knowledge

What advice do you have for current students?  
1) Take the entire first semester to figure out what kind of job interests you and what you want to become.  
After that, start working on your profile to get the job youâ€™re interested in having.  
2) Apart from the regular coursework, spend a lot of time on personal projects.  It helps you stand out from the crowd. 
3) Choose your electives wisely. 4) Enjoy your time in College Station; you will not get it again!

Write a brief (1000 -2000 word) statement addressing the following two questions:
What are your reasons for undertaking graduate study at the University of Maryland, College Park? 
Indicate, if appropriate any specific areas of research interest. You may wish to discuss past work in your intended field or allied fields, 
your plans for a professional career, or how you developed your interest in or knowledge of your chosen subject.
What life experiences have prepared you to pursue a graduate degree at a large and diverse institution such as the University of Maryland? 
Among the items you might care to include would be your financial, community and family background, or whether you are the first person in your family to 
pursue higher education or any other factors that you believe would contribute to the diversity of our academic community. You may also wish to give the graduate 
admissions committee some examples of your determination to purse your goals, your initiative and ability to develop ideas, and/or your capacity for working through problems independently.

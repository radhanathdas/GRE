What I would like to suggest is that dress well and prepare for the worst case and give your best. 
And as everyone says, confident is the main key. Always keep a smile on your face and look into the eyes of the officer 
when you answer and also be a little loud. These were the advice that I received from others which helped me a lot. 
And I was prepared well for why this university, why MS and what plans after graduation. But none of these questions 
were asked and rest that I answered was all framed at that moment by just remembering the key words.
Lastly what I would like to say is that just give your best and leave the rest to God.

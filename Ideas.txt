how does tatooing work

automated sensoring through machine learning and AI
there is already a solution from google on this 

create a profile of a player by using the video analysis
and then use that model of the player to run through various simulations and then see how they perform and then based on the positives and the negatives 
train the player or alter the tactices 

this can be the engine to do all sort of simulations

place the laptop track pad onto the movable mouse 
idea is that we have to move the mouse a lot which is quite in efficient 

how to reduce the momentum of the collision such that when there is an accident then the casuality is limited 
this can be applied to any collision not just between cars 
the ideal state would be that 
2 cars are coming at full speed and when they collide there is only a minor brush 


make workplace more engaging and productive 
problems friction in the system from the people and many feel its not needed 

reduction of resources
changes in manufacturing 
recycling 
usage of plastic 
usage of paper 
use of electricity 
transporation 
food 
authorized BOT collection system
ways of storage 

ask new questions or give inspired answers 

design a simple logic gates device 
and a electro magnet

He’s not into science for science’s sake – he wants to understand his world and make it better. 
“I see the world as a really dynamic place that I can change and affect,” he said in his appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. 
“And I love to use the math and science I’ve learned to help people.”
Aware of the problems and looking to provide the solutions with the things learnt 
Failure is progress and a normal part of the process. Whether it’s science or life, you have to start, fail and just keep pushing.

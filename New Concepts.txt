SRDF
symmetrics remote data facility

this system is to ensure that the data in primary server is backed up into remote server bit to bit
in a efficient manner, so that in case of casuality you have the power to resume service

this is a product of EMC and it is their flagship product
it uses the RAID technology
there needs to be 2 symmetrics systems 
primary will write data to symmetrics and that will intern write data to another symmetrics system through the links 
and that symmetrics at the secondary site will then write into backup server

RAID redundant array of indepedent disks 
is a storage management systems that looks after distributing the data among various disks 
to achieve high performance, protection and manage the storage

2=010
1=001
3 011

and 2&1=000 , return 1 only if both are 1 
or 2|3=011 , return 1 if either is 1 or both is 1
xor 2^1=011 , return 1 if either is 1 and return 0 if both 0 and both are 1 
not ~2=001 , invert the bits, you cannot do ~ in python, this will generally give -i-1
left shift , shift the bits left, generally the number doubles when moved by 1 and so on
right shift , shit the bits right, generally the number halves when moved by 1 and so on

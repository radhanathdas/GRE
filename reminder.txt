Hi,
Thank you checking
There are 2 colleges with December 15th deadline, let me know if the recommendation mail is missing, I shall resubmit the request.
Incase the mail is missing in the inbox, please check in the spam or all mails folder.
Earlier submissions would be great, because they have the advantage of being considered for scholarships.

Regards,
Manjit

my parents were not formally educated so opportunities were pretty limited
platform to leverage my existing knowledge and take it to the next level
The MS-MIS program was the catalyst in helping me shift gears and prepare to work on the higher level
business-oriented thinking to supplement my technical knowledge. 
Given that I have worked in the industry for 8 years, i know very well some of the problems that are 
plaguing the system, i would like to find innovative solutions for the same by expanding by breadth of knowledge 


What advice do you have for current students?  
1) Take the entire first semester to figure out what kind of job interests you and what you want to become.  
After that, start working on your profile to get the job youâ€™re interested in having.  
2) Apart from the regular coursework, spend a lot of time on personal projects.  It helps you stand out from the crowd. 
3) Choose your electives wisely. 4) Enjoy your time in College Station; you will not get it again!

jobs for me
relevant and challenging 
- i have already studied these and they are extension to what i know and an do
hard, very challenging and risk
- many of the things would be new to me and i do not have the ability yet to perform on those areas

your plans for a professional career, or how you developed your interest in or knowledge of your chosen subject.
What life experiences have prepared you to pursue a graduate degree at a large and diverse institution such as the University of Maryland?

Hello Bikash,
I have figured out in the last few days that, a lot of clever applicants have already applied by early November and before, to the same universities as mine and have already received the admit.
My naivety of applying in December has put me in a bad situation as the opportunity now has become very limited. Even though the deadline is much later, the universities are apparently not waiting till the last date for sending out admits. 
I very well know, you will be very busy and now is the holiday time. I know this is too much to ask but please check if it’s possible to submit all the recommendations as early as possible. This will complete my application for the review from university.
Thank you very much.

Hi Preetham,
Very sorry for multiple messages. I have figured out in the last few days that, a lot of applicants have already applied, to the same universities as mine and have already received the admit. Which means the admits now have become very limited.
Even though the deadline has passed for University of Buffalo; I don’t think few days delay will matter much. I very well know, you will be very busy, but please try emailing the recommendation them as early as possible (I had sent an email with template last week). That will be great help. Kindly let me know when done.
Thank you very much

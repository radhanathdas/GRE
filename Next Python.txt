Hello Bikash,
I have figured out in the last few days that, a lot of clever applicants have already applied by early November to the same universities as mine and have already received the admit.
This is really a scary situation for me as the opportunity now has become very limited.
Even though the last dates are much later, the universities don’t wait till the last date for sending out admits. I very well know, you will be very busy and now is the holiday time.
I know this is too much to ask but please check, if it’s possible to submit all the recommendations as early as possible.
Thank you very much.

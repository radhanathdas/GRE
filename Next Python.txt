Hey Bikash,
In the last few days I have figured that a lot of applicants have already applied by early November, to the same universities as mine and have already received the admit.
Basically what this means is I am screwed :D, now there are very limited admits. 
Even though the deadline is much later, the universities are apparently not waiting till the last date for sending out admits. 
I know this is too much to ask as you are very busy but please check if it’s possible to submit all the recommendations at the earliest that will be great help.
Thank you very much.

Hey Preetham,
Very sorry for multiple messages. In the last few days I have figured that a lot of applicants have already applied by early November, to Buffalo and have already received the admit.
Basically what this means is I am screwed :D, now there are very limited admits.
Even though the deadline has passed for University of Buffalo; I don’t think few days delay will matter much. I know you will be busy, but please try emailing the recommendation at the earliest that will be great help.

Thank you very much
